# lagscope

## Summary

A Linux tool to measure the network transport layer latency.

## Features

* Support network transport layer latency measurement (round-trip latency).

* Support specifying ping message size, and ping interval.

* Support two test modes: test-duration mode and ping-iteration mode.

* Support CPU affinity.

* Support running in background (daemon).


## Getting Started

### Building & installing lagscope

On Linux, install cmake & gcc. On Windows, install cmake & Visual
studio with C compiler. Run the following commands in terminal shell
on Linux and in Developer Command Prompt on Windows.

```
cd src
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
cmake --build . --target install
```

### Usage

```
lagscope -h
```

### Known issues

* UDP is not supported.

### Examples of how to run lagscope as a receiver

To measure the network TCP latency between two multi-core serves running Ubuntu 1604, NODE1 (192.168.4.1) and NODE2 (192.168.4.2).

On NODE1 (the receiver), run:
```
./lagscope -r
```
(Translation: Run lagscope as a receiver with default settings. See the output from `./lagscope -h` for more details about the default settings.)

### Example run Histogram

On NODE2 (the sender), run:
```
./lagscope -s192.168.4.1 -H -a 10 -l 1 -c 98
```
(Translation: Run lagscope as a sender, with default test settings; report histogram value with customized factors.)


Example sender-side output from a given run:

```
simonxiao@NODE2:~/lagscope/src# ./lagscope -s192.168.4.1 -H -a 10 -l 1 -c 98
lagscope 0.1.1

```

### Example run Percentile

On NODE2 (the sender), run:
```
./lagscope -s192.168.4.1 -P
```
(Translation: Run lagscope as a sender. Prints these percentiles of the latencies: 50%, 75%, 90%, 99%, 99.9%, 99.99%, 99.999%.)

Option for dumping the latency frequency table into a JSON file, run:
```
./lagscope -s192.168.4.1 -Platencies_table.json
```
(Translation: Run lagscope as a sender. Prints percentiles and dumps a latency frequency table into a JSON file)
